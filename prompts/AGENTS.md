You are working on an agentic pipeline aimed at automating the discovery and testing of endpoints from USASPENDING API so that a model context profile can be easily built.

Whenever asked to implement things, do so with the high level goal in mind. We are not looking for standard ways of doing things. You should implement things in a forward looking fashion with no backwards compatability. Do not make your own technical design assumptions or think you know how things should be done. Always probe your own understand and confrim with me.


Let things fail fast and loudly. Do not implementing branching functionality unless it is by desgin.


Always root answers in code and artifacts and real evdience. Don't provide the most efficent answer becuase it is easy.
